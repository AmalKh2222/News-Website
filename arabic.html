											Until, that is, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi unleashed a new wave of censorship.
											
											In the past three years, the former general has turned the screws on the entertainment and news industries. A new regulatory agency is overseeing output and censoring content. Soap operas, it insists, must contain no sex scenes, no blasphemy, no politics. Police and other authority figures should be presented in a positive light.
											
											El Adl says he thought he could manage by steering clear of the biggest taboos. But when he heard that police had raided the film set of a rival early this year because it lacked a necessary permit, he revised his view. He immediately halted work on the two soaps he was filming, fearing he too would run into trouble for not having a permit.
											
											He couldn’t operate in this environment, he said. “There was just one entity, one eye, one taste, one vision.”
											
											It is President Sisi’s vision – one of heroism and patriotic virtue. And it is being pursued with innovative techniques.
											
											In interviews, program makers, and news media executives described how the Sisi administration has clamped down with controls that they say are stricter than those that existed under Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt with a hard grip until being overthrown in 2011. Many details of the new methods are reported here for the first time.
											China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt are world's worst jailers of journalists
											For the fourth consecutive year, at least 250 journalists are imprisoned globally as authoritarians like Xi Jinping, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Mohammed bin Salman, and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi show no signs of letting up on the critical media. A CPJ special report by Elana Beiser

												<h1> Read about Araq News !</h1> </br>
											BAGHDAD — The antigovernment protests that have shaken Iraq for months took a brutal turn on Thursday when protesters lynched a 16-year-old boy who had fired a pistol in the air to try to shoo them away from his family’s home.
											
											The protesters stabbed him 17 times, hung him by his ankles from a traffic light pole and cut his throat. In videos of the scene, people in police uniforms can be seen in the midst of the mob, seemingly allowing the attack to take place.
											
											The rare outburst of violence by the protesters underscored the increasing tension on the streets after the killing of more than 400 protesters by government forces and a recent spate of attacks by other groups, while the absence of a response by either the police or bystanders, many of whom recorded the killing on their cellphones, raised questions about the complicity of Iraqi society.
											
											The Iraqi High Commission for Human Rights condemned the police behavior as well as the lack of any effort by citizens to stop the violence. “The presence of hundreds if not thousands of citizens who stood still, filming and watching is a dangerous development that confirms the society’s acceptance of violence,” said Ali al-Bayati, a commission member.
