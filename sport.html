												<strong>Liverpool are planning to make a move for Red Bull Salzburg winger Takumi Minamino in January.</strong></br>
												</br>
												
												Minamino, who is believed to have a release clause of Â£7.25m, played in both his side's Champions League group games against the Reds this season.
												
												The Japan international has scored nine goals in 22 appearances for Salzburg this season and provided 11 assists.
												
												Red Bull Salzburg sporting director Christoph Freund confirmed talks between the two clubs are taking place.
												
												One of Minamino's two Champions League goals this season came in Salzburg's 4-3 group stage defeat by Jurgen Klopp's side at Anfield in October.
												
												In the return on Tuesday, the Austrian side lost 2-0 but Minamino was a constant threat in the first half and Liverpool are keen to do a deal as they believe he is worth more than treble his release clause.
												
												Liverpool have stepped up their pursuit of the 24-year-old because interest in the Japan forward is increasing.
												
												Despite playing against Liverpool in this season's Champions League, the forward would be eligible to play for the holders in the competition if he does move following a rule change by Uefa last year.

												<strong>Efrain Alvarez might just be the most coveted North American footballer since Freddy Adu.</strong></br>
												</br>
												. The 17-year-old LA Galaxy forward has been called "by far the biggest talent in the MLS" by none other than Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It's little surprise then, that he's the subject of an international tug-of-war.
												
												Born in California to immigrant parents from Mexico, 'Efra' grew up in east Los Angeles and joined the Galaxy Under-9s when he was seven years old. Even at that age he was attracting some very influential admirers.
												
												One of his matches that season was watched by Eric Cantona. Legend has it the former Manchester United player - then director of football at New York Cosmos - was in town for a few under-17s and under-19s games. But it was Alvarez who caught his eye, with Cantona saying: "I've seen enough; I just want to watch this kid all day."
												
												The Frenchman moved on but Alvarez progressed. For the under-14s, he scored a Cantona-esque lob for his 24th goal in 19 games, and when he turned professional by joining the Galaxy's second team aged 15 years and one month, he became the youngest signing in United Soccer League history, usurping Alphonso Davies, the Canadian now playing for Bayern Munich.
